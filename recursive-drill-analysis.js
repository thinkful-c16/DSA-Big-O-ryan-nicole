//Counting Sheep - Linear - the number of sheep entered directly correlate with the number of times the function is run.

//Doubling Array - Linear - the amount of indexes in the array directly correlates to the number of times the function is run to double each index

//Reverse String - Linear - the number of characters within the string directly correlates to how many times the function has to recur in order to successfully reverse the string

//Nth Triangular Number - Linear - As you increment the number of your input, the run time increases proportionally

//String Splitter - Linear - This is linear because the amount of characters in the string you specify directly correlates to the number of times the function is run

//Binary Representation - Logarithmic - because it is only increasing very slowly as you increment your numbers for your input. IE 100 has 7 ticks while 5 has 5 ticks... so it only goes up 2 ticks on an increase of 95 on the input. Additionally, the problem is cut in half each time it runs. (math.floor/2 and the %2 runs as part of each recursion)

// Anagrams - Exponential - for every character added to the anagram it exponentially increases the amount of times the function has to run in order to give every variation of that word
